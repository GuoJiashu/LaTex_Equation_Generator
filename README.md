## ðŸ“š Project Overview

LaTeX-OCR is a deep learning pipeline for recognizing and converting images of handwritten mathematical expressions into LaTeX code. It uses:

- **Encoder**: ResNet34 backbone with 2D positional encoding and row-wise LSTM.
- **Decoder**: Transformer Decoder architecture.
- **Training**: Label smoothing loss, warm-up and cosine annealing scheduler.
- **Inference**: Beam Search decoding for sequence generation.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Supports handwritten mathematical formulas.
- Augmented training (random rotation, color jitter).
- Beam Search decoding for higher prediction accuracy.
- Token-level accuracy, Normalized Edit Distance (NED), and BLEU score evaluation.
- Visualization tools (loss curves, feature maps, confusion matrix).
